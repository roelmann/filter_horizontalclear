Horizontal Clear Filter
=======================
This filter simply allows a horizontal line which adds a 'clear:both' css rule without the need to go into the html code.
It is probably not needed in TinyMCE which already has an HR button, but that function does not appear to be present in Atto as yet.

Key:
====
[hr] - adds a horizontal rule with the clear:both rule clearing any floats and wrapping such as right aligning images
[hr-0] - adds a div with the clear:both rule so that the line itself is not drawn the way it is with the hr
